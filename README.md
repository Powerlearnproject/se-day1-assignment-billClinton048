Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
- Reliability - ensures softwares performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare, finance
- Security - implement protection  practise like authentication, authorization and encryption.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity 
mastering process 
mastering machine 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - first process to identify the software requirement 
Requirement analysis - this tell us about the final user specification 
Design building the framework 
Coding - converting the framwork into tangible code 
Testing - examine the software for any bug

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology This is a methodology which is linear and sequential, each phase is complete before moving on it is has low flexibiltiy testing is done ate the end of the development process.
Agile methodogy this is an iterative and incremental with multiple cycles(Sprints),it has high flexibility and testing is continuously and done after each iteration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - develops aplications,programs and systems using programming language and frameworks. maintains and update software to ensure its funtional
Quality assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement. create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team. Discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment importance:
- Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code.
- An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
- IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
- An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.

 Version Control Systems (VCS) importance:
- Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
- Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
- Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
- Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
- Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
- Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and fuctions of the classes, components or modules useds by you software.
integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
System testing - focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all fuctionalities and interactions
Acceptance tests - are formal test that verify if a systems satisies business requirements 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
- Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate
- bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
- Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
- developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
dashboard code 
Generate a html code and css to create a dashboard, the dashboard should display the name of the person the profile picture and should have a place to update the info that is reset password etc.
